Description: Automates the process of generating hexagonal cartograms for the U.S.,
    in the style of the Daily Kos election maps <https://dkel.ec/map>.
    Districts are built from hexagons and placed inside state boundaries to best
    approximate their real-world geography. States are sized and positioned to
    recreate the overall shape of the country while balancing the areas of each
    district.
