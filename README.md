# hexmap

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The **hexmap** package automates the process of generating hexagonal
cartograms for the U.S., in the style of the [Daily Kos election
maps](https://dkel.ec/map). Districts are built from hexagons and placed
inside state boundaries to best approximate their real-world geography.
States are sized and positioned to recreate the overall shape of the
country while balancing the areas of each district.

## Installation

You can install the development version of hexmap from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("CoryMcCartan/hexmap")
```
